# WebScrapping-Dashboarding-Regression

Webscrapping (and crawling) is just a super basic tool I needed to get my hands on. So is dashboarding. 

ShoeScrapping (done in August 2023) was my first project where I scrapped data from Zalando using a combination of Selenium and Requests (CFScrapper actually). I then displayed results in Dash. 

For ScientJournalTileScrapping (done in August 2023), I scrapped data from PubMed using Selenium and then did the data analysis in R (within a jupyter notebook). I had the suspicion that Scientific journal titles would reflect Scientific trends: for the time frame I looked at (roughly 2007 to 2023), and the journal (Cell) I looked at, I could not find strong and convincing trends, however. Still, nice practice.

ScrappingTwitterForAnimalwelfare was conducted in December 2023 (actually scraping Nitter not Twitter). It is an exploratory project to learn more about the political discussions on animalwelfare taking place on Twitter. Key starter questions were: How to analyze the discussion on animalwelfare on twitter? How to structure the information regarding animalwelfare on twitter? Do easy fixes exist: can hashtags be used to gain an overview on the animalwelfare discussion in twitter? Can subtopics be automatically identified? Can discussion participants be automatically classified? How diverse is the community in their information generation? I started looking into BERT libraries for text analysis.
