# WebScrapping-Dashboarding-Regression

Webscrapping (and crawling) is just a super basic tool I needed to get my hands on. So is dashboarding. ShoeScrapping (done in August 2023) was my first project where I scrapped data from Zalando using a combination of Selenium and Requests (CFScrapper actually). I then displayed results in Dash. For ScientJournalTileScrapping (done in August 2023), I scrapped data from PubMed using Selenium and then did the data analysis in R (within a jupyter notebook). I had the suspicion that Scientific journal titles would reflect Scientific trends: for the time frame I looked at (roughly 2007 to 2023), and the journal (Cell) I looked at, I could not find strong and convincing trends, however. Still, nice practice.
